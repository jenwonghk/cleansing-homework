The new dataset was merged and cleansed from the original data of the above link, each record of the new data set contains:
===========================================================================================================================
- Specific volunteer (1 to 30, have total 30 volunteers)
- Specific activity (Walking, Walking upstair, Walking downstair, Sitting, Standing, Laying, have total 6 type of activities)
- Average of the measurement of the features of mean
- Average of the measurement of the features of standard deviation

The new dataset includes the following files:
=============================================
'README.txt'

'x.csv': the dataset is the average of each variable (the measurement of mean or standard deviation) for each activity and each subject.

'codebook.txt': describe how the merging, cleansing and getting the new dataset of x.csv

'activity_labels.txt': 6 activity names of the experiement

'features.txt': 561 feature names of the experiment. During the cleansing process, we extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

'features_info.txt': description of those features
