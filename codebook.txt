The steps of generating the new dataset are as follows:

1. Use the original data in https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
   Then merge the training and the test sets (file name: X_train.txt & X_test.txt) to create one data set named x.

2. There are 561 features variable.  We extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for 
   each measurement.  Their feature names are used as column name.  For detail of the meaning of feature, 
   please refer to 2 files feature_info and features.

3. In the new data set x, the variable named subject is the activity performed.  
   Descriptive names (Walking, Walking downstair, Walking upstair, Sitting, Standing, Laying) are used.

4. In the new data set x, the variable named volunteer representing 1 to 30 volunteers.  
   Each number representing one volunteer, in total we have 30 volunteers.

5. Finally we make the average on each volunteer on each activity on the measurement of features on number 2 above.
